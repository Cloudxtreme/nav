    This class provides a very limited form of lazy evaluation. When
    setting a value in the dictionary, the value may be given either
    directly as when using an ordinary dictionary, or indirectly by a
    function for computing it. In the latter case, the function will
    be called (and the resulting value stored for later lookups) the
    first time the value is read from the dictionary.

    A lazy_dict may be used mostly as a dictionary. Values are read
    and written with the usual bracket notation (d[key]). For lazy
    values, a double bracket notation is provided. To set a lazy
    value, use

      d[[key]] = function

    or

      d[[key]] = (function, arg1, arg2, ...).

    If the same key is later looked up with single brackets, this
    function is called with these arguments (if any) and the resulting
    value returned.

    Double brackets may also be used for reading to copy a value (to
    another lazy_dict or a different key in the same dictionary)
    without evaluating it:

      d1[[key1]] = d2[[key2]].

    (The double bracket notation is not any special syntax, just a
    trick to create something which looks like it. As far as Python is
    concerned, the outermost brackets are exactly the same as in
    single bracket notation, while the inner brackets denote list
    construction. The bracket functionality is implemented by
    __getitem__ and __setitem__ (since Python automagically translates
    the expression d[k] to d.__getitem__(k) and the statement d[k]=v
    to d.__setitem__(k,v)), and these simply check whether their first
    argument is a list in order to determine whether single or double
    brackets are used. (Note that a list can not be used as a
    dictionary key, so this does not interfere with potential keys)).
