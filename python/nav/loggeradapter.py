        provides contextual information. This constructor signature allows
        easy stacking of LoggerAdapters, if so desired.

        You can effectively pass keyword arguments as shown in the
        following example:

        adapter = LoggerAdapter(someLogger, dict(p1=v1, p2="v2"))

        a logging call to insert contextual information. You can either
        manipulate the message itself, the keyword args or both. Return
        the message and kwargs modified (or not) to suit your needs.

        LoggerAdapter subclass for your specific needs.
