# This is the default global log level configuration file for NAV.
#
# All NAV programs, except pping and servicemon, will initialize their log
# levels from this file, possibly combining them with log settings from command
# line options and/or their own configuration files. This file can also be used
# to configure the log levels of third party Python modules used by NAV.
#
# If you want to use a separate configuration file for some NAV program, set
# and export the environment variable NAV_LOGGING_CONF to point to that
# configuration file before executing the program in question.
#

[levels]

# NAV logging is organized into a named hierarchy, so that log levels can be
# set differently for different parts of the code. The root of NAV's logger
# hierarchy is "nav". 

# This line initializes all NAV logging to the INFO level.  Available levels
# are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL.
nav = INFO


# Some other examples:
#
#nav.eventengine = INFO
#nav.ipdevpoll = INFO
#nav.ipdevpoll.jobs.jobhandler = DEBUG
#nav.ipdevpoll.plugins = DEBUG
#nav.smsd = DEBUG
#nav.web.auth = DEBUG
