Missing interfaces
==================

When an interface that is a part of a detention is removed from NAV, commonly
by removing the switch, Arnold will display a message regarding this. The
last known interface and switch will be displayed.

To close this detention just enable it manually. **This will not send any
commands to any network equipment**, only close the detention as seen from
the web interface.
